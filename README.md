Facial recognition programs, which use computer vision to recognize individuals in photographs, rely heavily on this field of study. Facial traits in photos are identified by computer vision algorithms, which then match those aspects to stored face profiles. In order to verify the identity of the people using consumer electronics, face recognition is increasingly being used. 

Facial recognition is used in social networking applications for both user detection and user tagging. For the same reason, law enforcement uses face recognition software to track down criminals using surveillance footage.

# Challenges of Computer Vision 


Creating a machine with human-level vision is surprisingly challenging, and not only because of the technical challenges involved in doing so with computers. We still have a lot to learn about the nature of human vision. 

To fully grasp biological vision, one must learn not just how various receptors like the eye work, but also how the brain processes what it sees. The process has been mapped out, and its tricks and shortcuts have been discovered, but, as with any study of the brain, there is still a considerable distance to cover.


Computer Vision Benefits:
* Understand faces just by one click, also shows the expressions whay they have.
* This model with few features tunning can be used in other domains like in Medical, Cafe, and in the SuperMarket.
